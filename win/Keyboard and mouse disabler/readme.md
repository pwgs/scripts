This script can be used to disable the inbuilt keyboard and trackpad of your laptop. Please note that this script requires Administrator privilege to run. Also, this script will restart your laptop after running. This script might not work for you because your trackpad might not be built by ELAN. So a version 2.0 of this script might include features to disable specific hardware as well as cover all the manufacturers.
